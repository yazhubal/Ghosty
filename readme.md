# 👻 Ghosty

**A Pico-8 Game Development Experiment**

Welcome to **Ghosty**, a small homebrew game developed for the [Pico-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

### 📖 About This Project

**Ghosty** is a test project created purely for **fun and educational purposes**.

The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning game development concepts and the **Lua** programming language. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with sprites, collision detection, game loops, and Pico-8's unique constraints.

> **Note:** This is a work in progress/experimental build. Expect bugs, messy code, and ghostly behavior!

### 🎮 Features

* **Platform:** Built entirely within the Pico-8 environment.
* **Language:** Written in **Lua**.
* **Graphics:** Custom pixel art sprites and map design.
* **Sound:** Original chiptune sound effects (SFX) and music patterns.
